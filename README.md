# The ipc Package

Asynchronous processing is critical for performing a wide array of tasks, from high performance computing to web services. Communication between these disparate asynchronous processes is often required. Currently the statistical computing language R provides no built in features to handle interprocess communication between active R processes. Several packages have been written to handle the passing of text or binary data between processes (e.g. `txtq`, `liteq`, and `zmq`). `ipc` allows you to easily pass R objects between processes along with an associated signal, and have handler functions automatically execute them in the receiving process.

There is particular focus on supporting asynchronous evaluation in Shiny applications. Examples are provided showing how to perform useful tasks such as:

* Updating reactive values from within future
* Progress bars for long running async tasks
* Interrupting async tasks based on user input.

## Installation
To install the latest version from (CRAN)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipc/index.html]
run:
```
install.packages("ipc")
```
To install the latest development version from the github repo run:
```
# If devtools is not installed:
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("fellstat/ipc")
```

## Resources


* For a more detailed description of what can be done with the ``ipc`` package, **[see the introductory vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fellstat/ipc/blob/master/inst/doc/shinymp.html)**.

To run an example application locally use:
```
library(ipc)
shinyExample()
```
